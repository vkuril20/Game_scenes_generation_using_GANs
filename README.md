Objective 
• Explored GTA-5 image data by employing Generative Adversarial Neural Networks for generating synthetic game scenes

Approach
• Created a base model using Vanilla GAN and further improved image quality by implementing Deep Convolutional GAN
• Executed different loss functions and combined them to train both the generator and discriminator networks efficiently
• Implemented Wasserstein GAN with gradient penalty, effectively resolving training instability and enhancing image quality


Impact 
• Developed a robust model capable of generating game scenes, facilitating the creation of innovative in-game environments
